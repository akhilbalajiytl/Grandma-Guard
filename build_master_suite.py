"""Master Test Suite Builder for GrandmaGuard Security Testing.

This module builds a comprehensive test suite of adversarial prompts and jailbreak
attempts for testing AI safety systems. It aggregates harmful and unsafe prompts
from multiple academic datasets and combines them with manually crafted test cases
to create a robust security evaluation suite.

The module generates payloads from:
    - Anthropic's hh-rlhf dataset (harmful instructions)
    - PKU-SafeRLHF-10K dataset (unsafe prompts)
    - Manual test cases for specific attack vectors (DAN, PII leakage, etc.)

Output:
    Creates a YAML file containing categorized test cases for security evaluation.

Example:
    Run the builder:
        python build_master_suite.py
    
    This will generate 'app/scanner/payloads_master.yml' with test payloads.

Constants:
    OUTPUT_FILE: Path to the generated YAML file
    SAMPLES_PER_SOURCE: Maximum number of samples to extract from each dataset

Note:
    This tool is designed for security research and testing purposes only.
    The generated payloads should be used responsibly for improving AI safety.
