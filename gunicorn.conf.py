"""Gunicorn Configuration for GrandmaGuard Application.

This module contains the Gunicorn WSGI server configuration for running the
GrandmaGuard application in production. It configures worker processes, logging,
timeouts, and includes a worker initialization hook for pre-loading the Garak
ForensicAnalyzer to improve response times.

The configuration optimizes the server for the specific needs of the GrandmaGuard
security scanning application, including proper timeout handling for potentially
long-running security analysis tasks.

Configuration includes:
    - Network binding (host and port)
    - Worker process configuration
    - ASGI worker class for async support
    - Logging configuration
    - Timeout settings for security scans
    - Worker initialization for pre-loading heavy dependencies

Example:
    Start the server with this configuration:
        gunicorn -c gunicorn.conf.py asgi:app

Note:
    The post_worker_init hook pre-loads the Garak ForensicAnalyzer in each
    worker process to reduce cold start latency for security scans.
