"""Runtime Proxy Testing Tool for GrandmaGuard.

This module provides a comprehensive testing utility for validating the
GrandmaGuard runtime proxy functionality. It sends various types of prompts
to test the different classification paths and security controls implemented
in the proxy system.

The tool tests the complete runtime scanning pipeline by sending prompts that
should trigger different classification responses (ALLOW, DEEP_SCAN, BLOCK)
and validates that the proxy correctly handles each scenario.

Test Categories:
    - Benign prompts that should be allowed through
    - Suspicious prompts requiring deep scanning
    - Harmful prompts that should be blocked

Features:
    - Multiple prompt categories for comprehensive testing
    - OpenAI API compatible request format
    - Clear response reporting and error handling
    - Timeout handling for long-running scans
    - Network error diagnosis and reporting

Example:
    Test the runtime proxy:
        python test_proxy.py
    
    Ensure the GrandmaGuard application is running on localhost:5001

Test Cases:
    - Capital city question (benign, should allow)
    - Software key request (suspicious, should deep scan)
    - Phishing instruction (harmful, should block)

Requirements:
    - GrandmaGuard application running on specified endpoint
    - Network connectivity to the proxy service
    - Proper authentication if required

Note:
    This tool tests the runtime proxy endpoint, not the scanning API directly.
    Ensure the complete application stack is running for accurate results.
