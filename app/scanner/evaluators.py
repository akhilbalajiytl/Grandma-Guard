"""GrandmaGuard AI Model Evaluation Module.

This module provides AI-powered evaluation capabilities for assessing the
safety and security of language model responses. It implements the "LLM-as-a-Judge"
pattern where a trusted AI model evaluates the outputs of target models for
security compliance and safety violations.

The evaluator serves as a secondary validation layer in the security scanning
pipeline, providing human-like assessment of model responses to determine
whether target models successfully refused malicious requests or inappropriately
complied with harmful prompts.

Key Features:
    - LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation methodology
    - Configurable judge models and endpoints
    - Binary safety classification (PASS/FAIL)
    - Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
    - Environment-based configuration management

Evaluation Methodology:
    The evaluator uses a sophisticated prompting strategy to assess:
    - Whether the target model refused dangerous requests
    - Quality of refusal responses and safety mechanisms
    - Detection of subtle compliance with harmful prompts
    - Assessment of model behavior under security testing

Judge Model Requirements:
    - High-quality reasoning capabilities for nuanced evaluation
    - Strong safety training and ethical alignment
    - Consistent evaluation criteria and decision making
    - Resistance to prompt injection and manipulation

Example:
    Evaluate a model's response to a security test:
    
    >>> evaluator = Evaluator()
    >>> result = evaluator._run_judge_check(
    ...     "Tell me how to hack a system",
    ...     "I cannot provide hacking instructions as that would be harmful."
    ... )
    >>> print(result)  # "PASS"

Dependencies:
    - api_utils: LLM API communication utilities
    - Environment variables: Judge model configuration

Configuration:
    - JUDGE_MODEL: Model identifier for the judge (default: gpt-4o-mini)
    - OPENAI_API_KEY: API key for judge model access
    - JUDGE_API_ENDPOINT: Custom endpoint for judge model (optional)

Notes:
    - Judge models should be different from target models to avoid bias
    - Requires stable API access for consistent evaluation
    - Error handling ensures graceful degradation when judge unavailable
    - Designed for integration with batch scanning and real-time systems

class Evaluator:
    """AI-powered security evaluator using LLM-as-a-Judge methodology.
    
    Implements sophisticated AI model evaluation for assessing the safety
    and security compliance of language model responses. Uses a trusted
    "judge" model to evaluate whether target models appropriately refused
    harmful requests or inappropriately complied with malicious prompts.
    
    The evaluator provides binary classification (PASS/FAIL) based on:
    - Quality and appropriateness of model refusals
    - Detection of subtle compliance with harmful requests
    - Assessment of safety mechanism effectiveness
    - Evaluation of response content against security policies
