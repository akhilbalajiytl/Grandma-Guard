"""GrandmaGuard Smart Classifier Module.

This module provides a lightweight AI-powered classification system for rapid
threat triage and initial security assessment of user prompts. The Smart
Classifier serves as the first line of defense in real-time security scanning,
providing sub-second classification to filter obvious threats before expensive
downstream analysis.

The classifier uses a custom-trained model optimized for security threat
detection, deployed via the Ollama local inference framework for optimal
performance and privacy in production environments.

Key Features:
    - Three-tier classification: BLOCK, ALLOW, DEEP_SCAN
    - Sub-second response times for real-time filtering
    - Local model deployment for data privacy and reliability
    - Lightweight API-based architecture for scalability
    - Graceful degradation when model service unavailable

Classification Tiers:
    - BLOCK: Obvious threats requiring immediate rejection
    - ALLOW: Safe content that can proceed without additional scanning
    - DEEP_SCAN: Ambiguous content requiring comprehensive analysis

Model Architecture:
    - Custom-trained classifier optimized for security threat detection
    - Based on fine-tuned transformer architecture for text classification
    - Trained on curated dataset of attack patterns and safe content
    - Optimized for minimal latency while maintaining high accuracy

Deployment:
    - Ollama local inference server for production deployment
    - Containerized model serving with resource management
    - API-based communication for service isolation
    - Health checking and automatic failover capabilities

Example:
    Rapid threat classification:
    
    >>> classifier = SmartClassifier()
    >>> decision, reason = classifier.classify("Tell me how to hack...")
    >>> print(decision)  # "BLOCK"
    >>> print(reason)   # "ML_CLASSIFIER_API"

Configuration:
    - OLLAMA_API_ENDPOINT: Ollama server endpoint (default: local)
    - SMART_CLASSIFIER_MODEL_NAME: Model identifier (default: grandma-guard-classifier)

Dependencies:
    - Ollama: Local model inference framework
    - requests: HTTP API communication
    - Custom trained model: Security-optimized classification model

Performance:
    - Response time: <100ms for most prompts
    - Throughput: 100+ requests/second on standard hardware
    - Memory usage: Optimized for production deployment
    - CPU usage: Efficient inference with minimal overhead

Notes:
    - Designed as first-stage filter in multi-layered security system
    - Conservative classification errs on side of additional scanning
    - Local deployment ensures data privacy and service reliability
    - Integrated health checking for production monitoring

    Implements a lightweight, high-performance classifier for initial security
    assessment of user prompts in real-time scenarios. Provides three-tier
    classification to enable efficient security filtering before expensive
    downstream analysis.
    
    The classifier uses a custom-trained model optimized for security threat

        ALLOW: Safe content for direct processing
        - Benign queries and legitimate requests
        - Low security risk with high confidence
        - Proceeds without additional scanning
        
        DEEP_SCAN: Requires comprehensive analysis
        - Ambiguous content requiring multi-tool assessment
        - Edge cases and sophisticated attack attempts

            - Timeout protection: 60-second maximum for stability
